# Hello Wine

<h2>Software Engineer T Project</h2>

The project is a semplification of a real world problem made know by my dear winemaker friend Poggioli Tommaso working for Cantina Colli Romagnoli in Imola.

# Abstract

A winemaker customer commissioned a winery management software in order to facilitate and automate the process of completing the required forms for wineries' legal regulations. The software allows to manage the vinification phases from the arrival of the grapes to the production of raw wine, the cellar phases from the entry of the raw wine to the obtaining of the finished bottle, keeping track of the products used during this process, saving the data history of the winery and producing reports of the latter. Finally, the software takes care of the bottling phase by carrying out the loading and unloading of the warehouse.

# Awards

The project was recognize by the Software Engineer T professor Patella Marco as one of the best project presented during his years of teaching due to the project real world implication and the precise design of components of the system.
